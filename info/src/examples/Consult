   Chief Complaint: Complete Heart Block
   HPI:
   Mr. [**First Name (Titles) 12101**] [**Known lastname 12100**] is 43 years old with hypertrophic
   cardiomyopathy.  He was diagnosed 3 years ago after experiencing severe
   exertional dyspnea.  Recent echocardiogram revealed asymmetric LV
   septal hypertrophy with LV septum measuring 17mm.  LVOT gradient was
   inducible to 125 mm Hg.  His symptoms progressed to NYHA Class III.  He
   had been treated medically with disopyramide 300 mg [**Hospital1 **] and complained
   of anticholinergic side effects related to this treatment.
   Yesterday he underwent alcohol septal ablation with contrast
   echocardiographic guidance.  Preablation LVOT gradient on 10 mg
   dobutamine measured 120 mm Hg, which subsequently decreased to 60 mm Hg
   after the procedure.
   We are asked to consult in the setting of post operative complete heart
   block.

   ECG: Sinus rhythm 100 bpm with complete heart block; ventricular escape
   of 46 bpm with [**Year (4 digits) 4696**] morphology.  QRS duration of 120 ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12102**]
   of the R wave intrinsicoid in multiple leads.
   With RV pacing at 60 bpm, no retrograde VA conduction observed.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12100**] is a 43 year old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
   and significant exertional limitation who underwent alcohol septal
   ablation yesterday.   Preprocedure ECG sinus with PR 164 and QRS 94
   ms.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] procedure ECG shows significant PR prolongation with RBBB and
   LAFB.   Current ECG shows complete heart block with QRS duration >120
   ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4696**] morphology.
   Will continue telemetry observation with VVI pacing backup (currently
   set to VVI 30 with appropriate threshold).
   If recovery of conduction does not occur will need permanent
   pacemaker/ICD.
