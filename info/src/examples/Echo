PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Chest pain. Coronary artery disease. NSTEMI. Hx CABG. Left ventricular function.
Height: (in) 71
Weight (lb): 200
BSA (m2): 2.11 m2
BP (mm Hg): 99/68
HR (bpm): 74
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2163-10-14**] at 09:11
Test: Portable TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild-moderate
regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal inferior
- hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral -
hypo;

AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR. Mild PA
systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. No PS.
Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal
half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 40-45 %). The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular cavity size with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution). Moderate mitral
regurgitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction. Dilated
ascending aorta. Pulmonary artery hypertension.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation. Based on [**2157**] ACC/AHA Valvular
Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year.
The patient has a mildly dilated ascending aorta. Based on [**2161**] ACCF/AHA
Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, if not previously known or a change, a follow-up
echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year; if previously known and stable, a
follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**2-25**] years.
Based on [**2158**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
