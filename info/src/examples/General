Clinician:  Resident
   Examined patient after he became asystolic on telemetry. I observed him
   for one minute and he made no spantaneous movement. He did not react to
   visual, verbal, or tactile stimuli. I palpated for a pulse for one
   minute in both radial and carotid arteries and none was palpated. We
   did turn off his ventilator and on listening to his chest there were no
   breath and heart sounds after one minute. He was pronounced dead at
   1:09am. A message was left for his primary care doctor. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 782**] was
   contact[**Name (NI) **] and declined autopsy.
   Total time spent:  20 minutes
