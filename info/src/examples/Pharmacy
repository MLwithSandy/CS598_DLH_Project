Pharmacy Note  - Sedation
   Assessment:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10195**] is currently intubated and sedated on propofol at 45
   mcg/kg/min; triglycerides ~ 700; consulted regarding transition from
   propofol to precedex during wean/extubation tomorrow morning.  Precedex
   is a
clonidine-like
 drug or alpha agonist which provides anxiolysis
   and has limited analgesic properties.
   Recommendation:
   To transition from propofol to dexmedetomidine (precedex), the RN
   should proceed as follows when the ICU team and RT evalutation
   demonstrate that this patient is ready to extubate:
    1. Initiate the precedex drip at 1 mcg/kg/minute with no bolus
       preceding the drip.
    2. After the precedex has infused for 1 to 2 hours, turn off the
       propofol with no need to titrate down
    3. Then, titrate the precedex drip in increments of 0.25 mcg/kg/min
       every 15 minutes (max dose is 1.4 mcg/kg/min) and monitor patient
       response during the transition period.
    4. Precedex can be infused before, during and after extubation with no
       risk of respiratory depression in the first 12 to 24 hours
       according to the manufacturer
s package insert; our experience at
       [**Hospital1 5**] confirms this.
    5. Importantly, the ICU team should consider supplementing the
       precedex with haldol, zyprexa or seroquel for any breatkthrough
       agitation (e.g. haldol 5 mg, zyprexa 5 mg or seroquel 25 mg
       q12hprn).  Supplemental antipsychotic can be sedative-sparing and
       avoid the need to restart or escalate sedative doses.
    6. After the breathing tube is pulled, the patient should be monitored
       per protocol and when clinically stable the precedex may be weaned
       down in increments of 0.25 mcg/kg/hr every 15 minutes until off.
   Please contact pharmacy with questions/concerns.

   This note needed to be amended to correct the dosage of precedex I
   stated, hence I am setting this note in
error
 with a replacement note
   to include the correct dose.  Precedex is infused at a rate of
   mcg/kg/HOUR.  Please refer to amended note.  The infusion is running at
   the correct rate and has been infused correctly to date.
