   Diagnosis
   Diagnosis 1: Impaired Arousal
   Diagnosis 2: Impaired Following Commands
   Diagnosis 3: Impaired Communication
   Diagnosis 4: Impaired Strength
   Clinical Impression / Prognosis
   Clinical Impression / Prognosis: Pt is a 75 yo male s/p L Basal Ganglia
   hemorrgage who presents functioning well below baseline. Performance in
   ADLs and Functional Mobility is limited by above impairments, as well
   as comprised pulmonary functioning, inattention, deconditioning 2'
   complicated course and inability to make needs known. Recommend daily
   multidisciplinary therapy to maximize functional I and safety once
   medically ready.
   Goals: patient / family, objective, measurable

   Goal 2: Respond to 50% yes/no questions by nodding head
   Goal 3: Eyes open for 100% of eval
   Goal 4: Comb hair c min hand-over hand A while maintaining grasp on
   comb
   Time Frame (expected attainment): 1 week
   Anticipated Discharge: Rehab
   Treatment Plan: Interventions; patient / family education, community
   resources
   Treatment Plan: F/u for UE therex, pt education, edema control, ADL and
   Fxnl mobility retraining, neuro re-education
   Frequency / Duration: 1-2xwk
   Recommendations for Nursing: Elevate B UE on pillows for
