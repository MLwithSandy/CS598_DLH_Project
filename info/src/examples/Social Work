Social Work
   SW present at family meeting today with MICU fellow, rn and pt
s wife,
   son, 2 [**Name2 (NI) 1981**] and son in law.  Family updated on pt
s condition and
   options for proceeding with care.  Fellow informed them of option of
   trach and peg and potential for surgery down the road, but that this
   would be  a long process for pt with no guarantees and high probability
   that pt will not return to baseline functioning or acceptable quality
   of life given pt
s previous functioning.    Fellow also presented
   option for shifting care to more of a comfort focus.
   Family understandably tearful with this news.  They report that pt had
   previous said that he would like everything done to preserve his life,
   but now family is questioning what pt would set to that given his
   current condition.  They are appropriately questioning long term
   benefits and understandably struggling with seeing pt currently in
   pain/discomfort.  They question if trach and peg would allow him to be
   less sedated and able to engage with them but also question ultimately
   to what end would this be.  Family feeling that they have had questions
   answered and have enough info to think things through as a family and
   will take at least the evening to do so.
   A/P
   Family seems to be processing and coping appropriately with realistic
   sense of pt
s situation.  Family appears to be supportive of one
   another and seemed jointly focused on pt
s comfort and quality of life
   as highest priority and trying to sort that out in light of pt
   previous stated wish for full care to preserve his life.  Family may
   benefit from palliative care consult as they consider pt
s options.
   SW will continue to follow for coping support.
